**Global Trend Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis on Gapminder Dataset**

**Libraries used for the EDA**

**1. NumPy (numpy)**

**Purpose:**

Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Usage in the Code:**

Although not explicitly used in the provided code snippets, NumPy is often utilized for numerical computations and array-based operations, which can be part of preprocessing or calculations.

**2. Pandas (pandas)**

**Purpose:**

A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, used for handling structured data (e.g., tabular data in DataFrames).

**Usage in the Code:**

Loading data: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
Manipulating data: Used for operations like grouping, filtering, creating new columns, pivot tables, and summarizing data.

**Examples:**

Creating a pivot table (pd.pivot_table).
Adding new columns (pd.cut for binning life expectancy into categories).
Handling missing values and checking column data types.

**3. Seaborn (seaborn)**

**Purpose:**

A Python visualization library based on Matplotlib, offering a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

**Usage in the Code:**

For visualizations like boxplots (sn.boxplot) and heatmaps (sn.heatmap) to understand distributions and relationships in the data.
Offers aesthetically pleasing plots with minimal configuration.

**4. Matplotlib (matplotlib.pyplot)**

**Purpose:****

The foundational plotting library in Python, used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

**Usage in the Code:**

Used alongside Seaborn for more control over plot details (e.g., adding titles, labels, and customizing plot appearance).

Examples include creating line plots (plt.plot()) and scatter plots (plt.scatter()).

**5. Tabulate (tabulate)**

**Purpose:**

Formats tabular data into simple, readable text tables.

**Usage in the Code:**

Although commented out, it is used to print tables in a formatted way (e.g., tabulate(pivot_table, headers='keys', tablefmt='fancy_grid')).
Useful for presenting tabular data in CLI outputs.

**Objective 1: Loading the Dataset**

Total Unique Countries: 142
Unique Countries List: Countries span all continents, with a wide representation of diverse geographies and economies.

**Objective 2: Average Life Expectancy Pivot Table**

Key Insight: Life expectancy has increased across all continents over the years. Europe and Oceania consistently show the highest averages, whereas Africa shows the lowest, indicating disparities in health outcomes.

**Objective 3: High GDP Per Capita Countries (2007)**

Criteria: GDP per capita above the 75th percentile.
Countries: Includes developed nations like Norway, Singapore, and the United States, highlighting global economic inequality.
Key Insight: A limited set of countries drive global wealth, most of them located in Europe, North America, and Asia.

**Objective 4: Life Expectancy Ranges**

Life expectancy grouped into 4 bins: Low, Medium, High, and Very High.
Distribution Insight: Regions like Europe and Oceania dominate the "Very High" range, while Africa features predominantly in the "Low" range.

**Objective 5: Top 5 GDP Per Capita Countries (2007)**

Countries: Norway, Kuwait, Singapore, United States, Ireland.
Visualization: A horizontal bar chart emphasizes stark GDP contrasts even among the wealthiest nations.

**Objective 6: Regex-Based Country Name Search**

Pattern: Countries starting with "I" and ending with "a."
Matching Countries: India, Indonesia.
Key Insight: Regex is an effective tool for filtering data based on patterns.

**Objective 7: GDP Distribution by Continent (2007)**

Boxplot Insight:
Oceania shows the smallest spread but highest median GDP per capita.
Africa has the widest spread, with most countries in lower GDP brackets.
Significant within-continent disparities exist.

**Objective 8: Life Expectancy Over 80 Years (2007)**

Countries: 14 nations with life expectancy >80 years, including Australia, Japan, and Iceland.
Continent Distribution:
Europe: Dominates with advanced healthcare systems.
Asia, Oceania, Americas: Representation from specific high-performing countries.

**Objective 9: Adding Decade Information**

Method: Extract decades from the year column.
Use Case: Enables temporal trend analysis across distinct periods.

**Objective 10: Correlation Matrix**

Key Correlations:
Positive: Life expectancy and GDP per capita (ùëü=0.58,r=0.58).
Weak: Population and GDP per capita (ùëü=‚àí0.02,r=‚àí0.02).
Heatmap Insight: Economic factors significantly influence health outcomes, while population size has minimal direct impact.

**Objective 11: Global Life Expectancy Trends (1952‚Äì2007)**

Visualization: A steady upward trend is evident, with the global average increasing from ~48 years in 1952 to ~70 years in 2007.
Contributing Factors:
Advancements in medicine and technology.
Public health campaigns and global development initiatives.

**Objective 12: Life Expectancy vs. GDP Per Capita (2007)**

Scatter Plot Insight:
Positive correlation: Wealthier countries achieve higher life expectancy.
Plateauing Effect: Beyond a certain GDP, further gains in life expectancy diminish.

**Objective 13: Average GDP Per Capita by Continent (2007)**

Bar Chart Insight:
Oceania leads due to high-income economies like Australia.
Africa lags significantly, underlining economic challenges.
**Subjective Analysis**

Global Economic and Health Dynamics
Economic Disparities:

Wealthier continents such as Oceania and Europe dominate GDP metrics.
Developing regions, notably Africa, struggle with lower GDP and life expectancy.
Health Improvements:

Significant global advancements in life expectancy highlight the success of public health efforts.
However, disparities in economic growth and healthcare access persist.
Trends Over Decades:

Increasing life expectancy correlates with advancements in technology and rising GDPs.
Economic growth is not equally distributed, contributing to uneven health outcomes globally.

**Conclusion:**

The Gapminder dataset reveals a nuanced narrative of global progress and inequality. While life expectancy and economic metrics show upward trends, regional disparities underscore the need for targeted policy interventions.
